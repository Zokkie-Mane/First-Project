        <li>Elon Musk was born in South Africa in 1971.</li>
        <li>
          He became famous for starting Tesla Motors and SpaceX but he first
          made his fortune as a co-founder of PayPal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk provided a large amount of inspiration for the Hollywood
          character Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man). In fact, parts of Iron Man 2
          were actually filmed inside and outside of SpaceX. Musk even has a
          cameo in the film!
        </li>
        <li>
          At age 12, Musk taught himself computer programming and created a
          video game called Blastar, which he sold for $500.
        </li>
        <li>
          After graduating, Musk moved to California in order to begin graduate
          school in physics at Stanford University. He left Stanford after just
          two days, deciding instead to take advantage of the Internet boom,
          which was in full swing. After dropping out of grad school, Musk
          quickly established his first company --Zip2, which provided online
          newspapers with maps and business directories. He sold the company in
          1999 for $307 million.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online payment company that
          eventually became PayPal before being acquired by eBay for $1.5
          billion in stock (of which $165 million was given to Musk).
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk co-founded Tesla Motors, a company that designs and manufacturers
          electric sports cars. Tesla was able to succeed in the electric car
          market where other large manufacturers failed. He now serves as CEO
          and chief product architect at Tesla.
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk is one of the major driving forces behind SolarCity, a company
          founded by his cousins. He is also the largest shareholder of the
          company.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elon Musk also founded SpaceX (a.k.a. Space Exploration Technologies),
          a company that creates and manufactures space launch vehicles, with a
          particular focus in rocket technology. His aim is to reduce the cost
          of space flight in hopes of expanding human life beyond Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk initially found it impossible to get funding for SpaceX, which
          investors saw as a pipe dream. Musk channeled all his own money into
          the company to make SpaceX a reality (going against every piece of
          business advice ever written).
        </li>
        <li>
          SpaceX has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to resupply (and
          eventually ferry people to) the International Space Station,
          effectively replacing the Space Shuttle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk has reduced the cost of reaching the International Space Station
          by 90%, bringing it down from $1 billion per mission to just $60
          million.
        </li>
        <li>
          Musk aspires for his Falcon rocket to someday make space tourism and
          the colonization of Mars a realistic goal for mankind. The Falcon
          rocket gets its name from Star Wars' Millennium Falcon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elon Musk has signed the Giving Pledge, in which pledges promise to
          donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropic efforts. The
          Giving Pledge has also been signed by Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson,
          Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg, among others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elon Musk owns Wet Nellie, a custom-built Lotus Esprit submarine car
          from the James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Federation Aronautique Internationale, which is the world
          governing body for aerospace records, presented Musk with the FAI Gold
          Space Medal in 2010 for designing the first privately developed rocket
          to reach orbit. It's the organization's highest award (and has also
          been awarded to Neil Armstrong).
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2013, Musk introduced his latest endeavor -- the Hyperloop, a new
          form of transportation that could theoretically send people from San
          Francisco to Los Angeles in half an hour by way of pressurized tubes.
          Musk has said if no one else will build it, he will do it himself.
